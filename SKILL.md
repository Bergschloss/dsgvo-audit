name: dsgvo-audit
description: Multi-phase DSGVO/GDPR compliance audit for the imma-help project (Germany). Scans Prisma schema, Fastify routes, Next.js App Router, Electron apps, SSE, Stripe, RustDesk, and Twilio integrations for personal data risks, missing legal bases, broken data subject rights endpoints, and third-party processor gaps. Use when invoked as /dsgvo-audit, asked for "DSGVO-Prüfung", "GDPR audit", "перевір DSGVO", "перевір захист даних", "dsgvo check", or "compliance check".
---

# Skill: dsgvo-audit

## Trigger

Use this skill when the user invokes `/dsgvo-audit`, asks for:
- "DSGVO-Prüfung", "GDPR audit", "перевір DSGVO", "compliance check"
- "чи є порушення GDPR", "які персональні дані ми збираємо"
- "перевір видалення акаунту", "data subject rights check"
- "третьостороні процесори", "Stripe AVV", "RustDesk DSGVO"

**STRICT READ-ONLY**: Never modify, refactor, or create files inside the project repository. Only write reports to `$outDir` under `_Reports`.

For security/auth/crypto depth — use `forensic-audit`. For UX/product logic — use `product-ux-audit`. This skill focuses exclusively on DSGVO/GDPR compliance surface.

## Stack Context (imma-help)

Always carry this context through every phase — do not re-derive:

| Layer | Tech | DSGVO relevance |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `apps/web` | Next.js 14 App Router | Frontend consent, cookies, Impressum, DSE |
| `apps/api` | Fastify + Prisma | Data processing, endpoints, logs |
| `apps/desktop` | Electron (client-facing) | Local PII storage, RustDesk credentials |
| `apps/desktop-operator` | Electron (operator) | Remote access initiation, session logs |
| `apps/desktop-admin` | Electron (admin) | Full data access, bulk operations |
| `@imma-help/db` | Prisma schema (shared) | PII model definitions, retention, cascades |
| Stripe | Payment processor | Art. 28 AVV, payment PII |
| RustDesk | Remote control | Sensitive: screen access = high-risk processing |
| Twilio | SMS/voice | Communication data, Art. 28 |
| SSE (`queue-sse.ts`) | Server-Sent Events | PII leakage in event payloads |
| Cron jobs | Background tasks | Retention enforcement, deletion automation |

---

## Execution Protocol

### Pre-flight (before any phase)

1. **Task list**: Create a TaskCreate entry for each phase. Mark each `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when the phase file is verified. Never mark a phase complete without file verification.

2. **Resolve output path**:
   ```powershell
   $outDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\_Reports\dsgvo-audit_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd_HHmm')"
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $outDir
   ```
   Abort if creation fails.

3. **Repo context** (embed in every report header):
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --short HEAD
   git branch --show-current
   git status --short
   ```

4. **PII Quick Scan** (run before Phase 0 to orient findings):
   ```bash
   # Personal data patterns in source
   rg -i "email|phone|telefon|name|address|adresse|geburtstag|birthdate|iban|kontonummer" \
     --type ts --type tsx -l

   # PII in console.log / app.log
   rg "console\.(log|error|warn)\(.*?(email|phone|name|token|password|rustdesk)" \
     --type ts -l

   # PII in SSE event payloads
   rg "reply\.raw\.write|res\.write|sendEvent" --type ts -l

   # Hardcoded PII or secrets in source
   rg -i "password\s*=\s*['\"][^'\"]{4,}|api_key\s*=\s*['\"]|secret\s*=\s*['\"]" \
     --type ts -l

   # Missing DSGVO endpoints
   rg "dsgvo|gdpr|delete-account|export|auskunft|loeschung" \
     --type ts -i -l

   # RustDesk credential storage
   rg "rustdesk|rdPassword|rdId|remoteId|accessCode" --type ts -l

   # Consent logging
   rg "consent|einwilligung|zustimmung|agreed|acceptedAt" --type ts -l

   # TODO/FIXME markers in DSGVO-adjacent code
   rg "TODO|FIXME|HACK" --type ts | rg -i "dsgvo|gdpr|delete|consent|privacy|datenschutz"
   ```

5. **Schema snapshot**:
   ```bash
   cat packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma
   # or:
   rg --files | rg "schema\.prisma"
   ```
   Read the full schema — it defines the PII surface.

### Report Header Template

```md
# [Phase Title]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Repo**: [repo root path]
**Git HEAD**: [short hash] ([branch])
**Dirty files**: [git status --short output or "clean"]
**Auditor role**: [role for this phase]
---
```

### Finding Format

```
[file:line] SEVERITY — short title

**Observed**: what the code actually does (cite file:line)
**DSGVO Article**: Art. XX — what it requires
**Gap**: what is missing or broken
**Risk**: concrete consequence (fine, complaint, data breach)
**Fix direction**: concrete next step (no full rewrites)
```

Severity: **CRITICAL** (Art. violation, fine risk > €20k) / **HIGH** (likely violation, complaint risk) / **MEDIUM** (gap, best-practice miss) / **LOW** (minor, documentation gap) / **NOTE**.

---

## Phase Discipline

- **Fresh pass per phase** — do not rely on prior-phase memory; re-read relevant files for each phase's specific lens.
- **Cross-phase dedup** — if a finding was already reported in a previous phase, write `→ see Phase N: [brief label]` instead of repeating the full finding. Ownership:
  - **Phase 0** owns PII inventory findings (what data exists, where it lives).
  - **Phase 1** owns legal basis findings (Art. 6/7/9 gaps).
  - **Phase 2** owns data subject rights findings (Art. 15-22 endpoint gaps).
  - **Phase 3** owns retention/minimization findings (Art. 5 storage limitation).
  - **Phase 4** owns third-party processor findings (Art. 28/44ff gaps).
  - **Phase 5** owns technical security findings (Art. 32 measures) — defer depth to `forensic-audit`.
  - **Phase 6** owns DPIA/Impressum/DSE findings.
  - If a finding fits multiple phases, record it fully in its owning phase and reference by `file:line` from the other.
- **Sequential phases** — Phase N+1 starts only after Phase N's deliverable is written and verified (> 500 bytes).
- **Verify write**: after each phase, confirm the deliverable file exists and contains at least one substantive finding. If a phase genuinely has zero findings, write an explicit "No findings — checked: [what was checked]" line.

---

## Phase 0 — PII Inventory

**Role**: EU Data Protection Officer.
**Task**: Create a complete map of what personal data imma-help collects, where it lives, and under what legal basis.

### PASS 1: Prisma Schema PII Audit

Read `schema.prisma` (find via `rg --files | rg schema.prisma`). For every model, identify:
- Fields that are personal data (name, email, phone, address, IP, device ID, behavioral data)
- Fields that are special category data (Art. 9): health, biometric, location, access logs to private computers
- Whether each field has `@db.Text`, encryption marker, or is stored plaintext
- `onDelete` behavior — does cascade wipe PII or leave orphaned records?

**RustDesk-specific**: `rdId`, `rdPassword`, `accessCode`, or equivalent fields — these grant access to a private computer and qualify as **sensitive data** requiring heightened protection (Art. 9(1) analogy or at minimum Art. 32 strong encryption).

### PASS 2: Data Flow Map

For each PII category found in PASS 1, trace:
- Where it enters the system (registration form, operator input, API call)
- Which services/apps can read it (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, Electron apps)
- Whether it leaves the system (Stripe, Twilio, RustDesk relay server, external APIs)
- Where it is deleted (or not)

### PASS 3: Log & SSE PII Leakage

Check Fastify route files and SSE handler for PII appearing in:
- `console.log` / `app.log` / `fastify.log`
- SSE event payloads (`reply.raw.write(...)`)
- Error response bodies sent to client
- HTTP response headers

**Deliverable**: `$outDir\audit_0_pii-inventory.md`
**Verify write**: file must exist and be > 500 bytes before Phase 1 begins.

---

## Phase 1 — Legal Basis & Consent (Art. 6, 7, 9 DSGVO)

**Role**: EU DPO + DSGVO-Anwalt.
**Fresh pass** — re-read relevant files; do not rely on Phase 0 memory.

### PASS 1: Art. 6 Legal Basis per Processing Activity

For each PII category from Phase 0, determine which legal basis is claimed in practice:
- `lit. b` (Vertragserfüllung): processing necessary to deliver the service
- `lit. c` (rechtliche Verpflichtung): legal obligation (tax, commercial law)
- `lit. f` (berechtigtes Interesse): legitimate interest — is a balancing test documented?
- `lit. a` (Einwilligung): consent — see PASS 2

Check: is the legal basis actually documented anywhere in the codebase (comments, Datenschutzerklärung, database)? Or is it assumed?

### PASS 2: Consent Mechanism (Art. 7)

- Is consent collected before remote control sessions (RustDesk access)? Where is it logged?
- Is consent for marketing/tracking (if any analytics are present) collected with a proper consent banner (§25 TTDSG for cookies)?
- Check `apps/web` for: cookie banner, consent state storage, consent withdrawal mechanism.
- Is consent timestamp, IP, and text version stored immutably? (Nachweispflicht Art. 7(1))

### PASS 3: Special Category Data (Art. 9)

RustDesk grants access to a private computer — this may constitute processing of data revealing **private life** and requires a specific Art. 9(2) exception or at minimum an explicit consent (Art. 9(2)(a)).

Check whether:
- The privacy notice mentions this processing
- An explicit consent is obtained before first remote session
- The legal basis for storing RustDesk credentials is documented

### PASS 4: Purpose Limitation (Art. 5(1)(b))

Are data collected for one purpose used for another? Check:
- Does operator data (names, session logs) flow into analytics?
- Does client registration data get used for marketing without separate consent?

**Deliverable**: `$outDir\audit_1_legal-basis.md`
**Verify write**: > 500 bytes before Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 — Data Subject Rights (Art. 15–22 DSGVO)

**Role**: EU DPO + QA Automation Lead.
**Fresh pass.**

For Germany: all requests must be fulfilled within **1 calendar month** (Art. 12(3)). Deadline runs from receipt. Extension to 3 months possible if complex — but user must be informed within month 1.

### PASS 1: Auskunftsrecht (Art. 15) — Right of Access

Find the data export/access endpoint (likely `GET /api/dsgvo/export` or similar):
- Does it return ALL personal data for the requesting user?
- Does it include: processed data, purposes, legal bases, retention periods, third-party recipients, source of data?
- Is it scoped to the requesting user only (no IDOR via user ID swap)?
- Is the download URL time-limited or user-scoped?

### PASS 2: Recht auf Löschung (Art. 17) — Right to Erasure

Find the account deletion endpoint (likely `POST /api/dsgvo/delete-account`):
- Does it cascade-delete or anonymize ALL PII in all related models?
- Check every Prisma model with a `userId`/`clientId` relation — does `onDelete: Cascade` or `onDelete: SetNull` apply, or is the delete manual?
- Are RustDesk credentials (rdId, rdPassword) wiped on deletion?
- Are session recordings, chat logs, appointment history deleted or anonymized?
- Is there a retention exception logged (Art. 17(3) — legal obligation to keep billing records 10 years)?

### PASS 3: Recht auf Berichtigung (Art. 16) — Rectification

- Is there an endpoint/flow for users to correct their personal data?
- Does it update all copies (Prisma DB + any caches)?

### PASS 4: Datenübertragbarkeit (Art. 20) — Data Portability

- Does the export (Art. 15) also serve as the portability export?
- Is data exported in a machine-readable format (JSON, CSV) — not just human-readable PDF?

### PASS 5: Widerspruchsrecht (Art. 21) — Right to Object

- If legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)) is used as legal basis for any processing: is there an object/opt-out mechanism?
- Is there an unsubscribe/opt-out for any marketing communications (if Twilio is used for notifications)?

### PASS 6: Deadline Tracking

- Is there any mechanism to track incoming data subject requests and their 1-month deadlines?
- Or does this entirely rely on manual process? (Note: this is a compliance gap even if not a code issue)

**Deliverable**: `$outDir\audit_2_subject-rights.md`
**Verify write**: > 500 bytes before Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3 — Data Minimization & Retention (Art. 5 DSGVO)

**Role**: EU DPO + Principal DBA.
**Fresh pass.**

### PASS 1: Datensparsamkeit (Art. 5(1)(c)) — Data Minimization

- Are there fields in Prisma models that are collected but never used in the application logic?
- Are full addresses stored when only city/postal code is needed?
- Are precise timestamps stored everywhere or only where needed?
- Is the full RustDesk session content logged, or only metadata?

### PASS 2: Speicherbegrenzung (Art. 5(1)(e)) — Storage Limitation

- Is there a documented retention policy per data category?
- Are there cron jobs that enforce deletion after retention period?
  - Check `proactive-outreach.ts` and other cron files for any deletion logic
  - If none exists: HIGH finding
- Session logs, appointment history, queue entries — are they ever deleted automatically?
- Stripe payment records: 10-year HGB retention is legal, but other Stripe webhook data?

### PASS 3: Anonymization vs Deletion

When an account is "deleted", does the system:
- Truly delete PII (preferred), or
- Anonymize (replace with `[deleted]` / null / hash)?
If anonymization: is it complete? No re-identification risk from remaining fields?

**Deliverable**: `$outDir\audit_3_retention.md`
**Verify write**: > 500 bytes before Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4 — Third-Party Processors & Data Transfers (Art. 28, 44ff DSGVO)

**Role**: EU DPO + Contract Lawyer (DE).
**Fresh pass.**

### PASS 1: Stripe (Zahlungsdienstleister)

- Stripe processes payment card data and billing PII — **Auftragsverarbeiter** (Art. 28)
- Check: is a Data Processing Agreement (DPA/AVV) with Stripe in place? (Stripe provides a standard DPA — but does imma-help accept it?)
- Does Stripe send webhook data that includes PII? Check webhook handler for what's logged.
- Stripe servers in USA → international transfer. Is the Stripe DPA + SCCs sufficient? (Current: Stripe has EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequacy)

### PASS 2: RustDesk (Fernzugriff)

This is the highest-risk processor:
- Is RustDesk self-hosted (then: no third-party transfer) or using RustDesk's public relay servers (then: data transfer, potentially outside EU)?
- Find RustDesk config in `apps/api` or `apps/desktop` — what relay/rendezvous server is configured?
- If public RustDesk relay: where are these servers located? Transfer to non-EU = need SCCs or adequacy decision.
- Is there an AVV with RustDesk GmbH or the relay operator?
- Screen content during remote sessions — is it logged/recorded? Where?

### PASS 3: Twilio (Kommunikation)

- Twilio processes phone numbers and message content — **Auftragsverarbeiter**
- Is Twilio's DPA accepted?
- Twilio servers: EU region configured or US default? Check Twilio client initialization for region config.
- SMS content: does it include PII (names, appointment details)?

### PASS 4: Other Third Parties

- Any analytics tools on `apps/web` (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)? Check `layout.tsx`, `_app.tsx`, script tags.
- Error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)? Does it send PII in error payloads?
- Email provider (SendGrid, SES, Postmark)? AVV in place?
- Hosting provider (Hetzner, as mentioned earlier) — AVV for server hosting?

**Deliverable**: `$outDir\audit_4_processors.md`
**Verify write**: > 500 bytes before Phase 5.

---

## Phase 5 — Technical Security Measures (Art. 32 DSGVO)

**Role**: EU DPO + Security Engineer.
**Fresh pass. NOT a full security audit — defer depth to `forensic-audit`. Focus on DSGVO Art. 32 minimum.**

### PASS 1: Verschlüsselung (Encryption at Rest & in Transit)

- RustDesk credentials (`rdId`, `rdPassword`) in database: encrypted or plaintext? Find the field and check for encryption helper usage.
- Client PII fields (name, address, phone): any field-level encryption, or rely solely on DB-level encryption?
- Is the database connection using TLS? (`DATABASE_URL` contains `sslmode=require`?)
- HTTPS enforced for all `apps/web` and `apps/api` endpoints?

### PASS 2: Zugriffskontrolle (Access Control)

- Can `apps/desktop` (client-facing) access other clients' data via API? Check ownership guards.
- Can operators see data of clients not assigned to them?
- Admin endpoints (`/api/admin/*`): role-checked, or any authenticated user can call them?

### PASS 3: Pseudonymisierung (Art. 32(1)(a))

- Are analytics/logging events pseudonymized (hashed user IDs, not raw email)?
- Queue entries visible in SSE: do they contain full client names, or only IDs?

### PASS 4: Verfügbarkeit und Belastbarkeit (Art. 32(1)(b)(c))

- Is there a documented backup strategy? (Code evidence: backup cron, DB dump scripts)
- Note: full DR planning is out of scope here — flag absence as MEDIUM/LOW.

### PASS 5: Verletzungsmeldung Readiness (Art. 33/34)

- If a data breach occurs: is there a process (even non-code) to notify BfDI/Landesdatenschutzbehörde within 72 hours?
- Check for any breach detection/alerting code (anomaly detection, failed access alerts)
- Note absence as MEDIUM — this is mostly procedural but should be flagged.

**Deliverable**: `$outDir\audit_5_technical-measures.md`
**Verify write**: > 500 bytes before Phase 6.

---

## Phase 6 — DPIA Threshold & Impressum/DSE Check

**Role**: EU DPO.
**Fresh pass.**

### PASS 1: DSFA-Schwellenwert (Art. 35 DSGVO) — DPIA Threshold

imma-help likely triggers a DPIA because of RustDesk remote access (systematic monitoring of private computers). Check against EDPB WP248 rev.01 criteria:

| Criterion | imma-help | Triggered? |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Evaluation/scoring of persons | — | Check if operators rate clients |
| Automated decision-making | — | Any AI/auto-routing? |
| Systematic monitoring | RustDesk screen access | **Likely YES** |
| Sensitive/special category data | Remote computer access | **Likely YES** |
| Large scale | Depends on user count | Check |
| Matching/combining datasets | — | Check |
| Vulnerable subjects | Elderly clients likely | **Likely YES** |
| New technology | RustDesk + AI | **Likely YES** |
| Transfer to third countries | RustDesk relay? | Check Phase 4 |

If ≥ 2 criteria: DPIA is **mandatory**. Flag as CRITICAL if no DPIA exists.

### PASS 2: Impressum (§5 DDG / §5 TMG)

Check `apps/web` for Impressum page (likely `/impressum` route):
- Vollständiger Name / Firmenname
- Anschrift (kein Postfach)
- E-Mail-Adresse
- Handelsregisternummer (if GmbH/UG/AG)
- Umsatzsteuer-ID or Steuernummer
- Verantwortlicher für den Inhalt (§18(2) MStV)

### PASS 3: Datenschutzerklärung (Art. 13/14 DSGVO)

Check `apps/web` for Datenschutzerklärung page:
- Verantwortlicher mit vollständiger Adresse
- Datenschutzbeauftragter (if required: §38 BDSG — 20+ employees processing automatically)
- All processing activities listed with legal basis and purpose
- Third-party processors named (Stripe, Twilio, RustDesk)
- Data subject rights explained (Art. 15-21)
- Right to lodge complaint with supervisory authority (Aufsichtsbehörde for the Bundesland)
- Cookie notice (if any tracking cookies used)
- International transfers disclosed

**Deliverable**: `$outDir\audit_6_dpia-impressum.md`
**Verify write**: > 500 bytes before Final.

---

## Challenge Pass (before Final Deliverable)

Before writing the master summary, validate every CRITICAL and HIGH finding from all phases.

- If subagents are available: spawn one fresh subagent (no shared context, read-only) per batch of findings. Give it only the finding text + repo path — not your reasoning. Ask it to verify each finding against the actual code and answer for each: **Confirmed / Overstated (downgrade severity) / Not an issue (drop)**, with a one-line reason.
- If subagents are not available: re-read the cited `file:line` yourself with fresh eyes and apply the same three-way verdict.

Apply the verdicts (drop/downgrade/keep) before building the rollup table. Note in the master summary how many findings were dropped/downgraded and why — this is a signal of audit quality, not a failure.

---

## Final Deliverable

Write `$outDir\audit_master_summary.md`:

```md
# DSGVO Audit — Master Summary

## Constraints

- **READ-ONLY** on project source. Zero writes inside the repository.
- **Evidence-only**: every finding cites `file:line`. No speculation framed as fact.
- **Timestamped output**: never overwrite previous audit runs.
- **Sequential phases**: Phase N+1 starts only after Phase N file is confirmed written and > 500 bytes.
- **TaskCreate/TaskUpdate**: create a task per phase at start, mark `in_progress` when beginning, `completed` after file verification.
- **No overlap with forensic-audit**: if a security vulnerability surfaces (e.g. IDOR), note it with pointer "→ forensic-audit for depth" rather than full finding.
- **No overlap with product-ux-audit**: UX issues noted only if they directly cause a DSGVO gap (e.g. consent dialog not visible).
- **Germany-specific**: all legal references are DSGVO + BDSG + TTDSG/DDG + applicable Landesrecht. Not UK GDPR, not US privacy law.
- **Severity = regulatory risk**, not exploitability. CRITICAL = Art. 83(5) fine territory (up to €20M or 4% global turnover).
- **Permission Handling**: If you do not have permission to write directly to `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\_Reports`, request it using `ask_permission` for `write_file` with the target path, or execute file write operations via the `run_command` tool in PowerShell.
